# golang-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for starting a Golang project in Bazel. I use it for my personal Golang projects.

This contains two examples:

1. Hello world binary for just printing hello world
2. Hello world gRPC example with client/server

You can find more details about how to run different commands to invoke different targets in the [Makefile](/Makefile).
